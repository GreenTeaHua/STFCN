# STFCN
This project is about proposing an architecture base on fully convolutional networks to include spatio-temporal features of regions for semantically scene segmentation. We named this end-to-end trainable module as STFCN.
This work is published as a paper "STFCN: Spatio-Temporal FCN for Semantic Video Segmentation" on https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05971.
A newer verion of this work, "STFCN: Spatio-Temporal Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Street Scenes" has been accepted in ACCV 2016 Workshop on Computer Vision Technologies for Smart Vehicle.
The source code will be available as soon as possible...
